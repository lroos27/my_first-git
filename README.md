# my_first_git
My first git XP Lab


Here you can find a few folders which include some empty(!) files.

In the first folder: analyses you can find a file which should include some analyses of a paper.
In the second folder: data you can find some EEG data stored in a .csv file.
In the third folder: experiments there is a file which the participants need to sign before doing the experiment.
In the fourth folder: notes there are my notes from the self-practice exercises.
In the fifth folder: writing there is a first draft of my introduction.
